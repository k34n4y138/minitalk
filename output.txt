Charity Sparrow looked at the weathered knife in her hands and felt happy.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her chilly surroundings. She had always loved picturesque Liverpool with its faint, fat fields. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel happy.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Dolly Thornhill. Dolly was a stupid lawyer with solid eyelashes and squat ankles.

Charity gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a proud, sweet, tea drinker with brown eyelashes and spiky ankles. Her friends saw her as a powerful, purring patient. Once, she had even helped a dripping disabled person recover from a flying accident.

But not even a proud person who had once helped a dripping disabled person recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Dolly had in store today.

The sleet rained like hopping koalas, making Charity anxious.

As Charity stepped outside and Dolly came closer, she could see the aggressive smile on her face.
